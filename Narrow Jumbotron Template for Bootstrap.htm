	<h2>How Political Parties Shape Electoral Competition</h2>
          <p>Across many established democracies a particular pattern can be observed: Political competition (as measured by vote margins) is intense in national elections, but much less so at regional levels. In fact, it is not uncommon that a single party monopolizes a regional office over long periods of time. In this paper I present a model of party formation that is able to explain this pattern. A key feature is that voters are poorly informed about the policies that individual candidates stand for at regional levels. As in Snyder & Ting (2003), parties provide some of this information by allowing only certain types of politicians to join. In order to compete a party therefore needs to attract and retain the right kinds of politicians. When choosing which party to affiliate themselves to, politicians evaluate which party offers better career prospects. A central result is that an equilibrium with a single party does not exist as this entails intense internal competition for nominations. Centrist politicians are then willing to defect to a second party as they know that they are in a good position to contest elections on their own. Once more than one party exists, however, such defections become less likely to be successful. I demonstrate the existence of an equilibrium with a centre-left and a centre-right party, where each party wins the national election with positive probability while monopolising some regions. The model makes a number of empirical predictions regarding the careers of politicians. </p>

	<h2>Competing Candidates, Competing Interest Groups, and the Efficacy of Political Threats</h2>
          <p>Interest groups seem to achieve large policy favours for small sums of campaign contributions. This has long puzzled observers. I provide an explanation of this so called "Tullock paradox" that is robust to competition among opposing interests. In the model, I allow interest groups to specify their donations as very general functions of policies and donations by other groups. This allows potential donors to influence the policy choice of an incumbent through threats of contributions to the campaign of a challenger. It is therefore possible that the incumbent chooses policies that favour a particular interest group even if this group has not made any actual donations. When lobbies face a small amount of uncertainty about the policy that the incumbent will choose, I am able to provide a clear characterisation of equilibrium. Policies are always skewed in favour of the group with deeper pockets. This group may also use actual donations on top of threats in order to increase its influence over policies. The weaker lobby, on the other hand, does not promise any money for any policy the incumbent may implement. Outcomes nevertheless differ from the case with only one interest group as the weaker group can become active if the stronger group tries to exert even more pressure. </p>
